       Make sure to wash your Cabbage! 
       Start by cutting your head of cabbage into halves and remove the core. Then take the halves and cut them into large shreds. Then dice your onion into small pieces.
       Then put your 2 Tbsp of avocado oil in your pan and heat on medium-high heat.

    <h3 class = "iheads">Cooking</h3>
        
    <p class = "paras">
        Once your pan is heated sufficiently, its time to start the cooking process. Start by cooking your diced onion in the pan until it is moderatley soft. 
        Than add in minced garlic and cook it for 30 more seconds. After cooking the garlic, add half of you cabbage into the pan and then season it with Paprika, Nature's Seasoning, and salt. 
        After seasoning, add the rest of your cabbage to your pan and season again. Next, you want to cover your pan with a lid. Stir occasionally until the cabbage is tender. You want to make sure 
        that your cabbage is cooking, but maintains a crunch. Enjoy!
